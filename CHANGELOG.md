# Changelog

Notable shipped changes and implementation facts future agents need. Trivial copy/token churn does
not belong here. Detail checklists live under [`docs/en/features/`](docs/en/features/).

## Unreleased

### Documentation

- Rebuilt agent constitution ([AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)), Cursor rules, policies, feature-stage docs, and
  English Apple-platform knowledge base.
- README reduced to public overview + eight macro stages; minutiae moved to feature docs.
- July 2026 research and notes export archived under [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/); duplicate
  `research/en` + `research/ru` trees removed.
- Continuity policy replaces the old absolute “no skeletons” rule: stale-first rendering first;
  exact-layout skeletons only on true cold loads.

## 2026-08 — Native UI remediation (historical)

Agent-relevant facts from the remediation pass (verify in code before assuming still true):

- Home: contained 16:9 banner shelf; Netflix `showsFeaturedPreview` path deleted.
- Blur: private `CAFilter` `variableBlur` over static art; Metal progressive blur removed; no blur
  over video on tvOS/macOS.
- Hero CTAs: white Play pill + translucent secondaries (not Liquid Glass on hero).
- Navigation: unified `Route` + `RouteDestination`; zoom transitions on iOS/tvOS.
- Detail: single vertical `ScrollView` (offset slideshow removed).
- Playback: app-scoped `PlaybackSession` (one `PlayerManager` at a time).
- Shell: shared `.sidebarAdaptable` `TabView`; macOS profile via `tabViewSidebarBottomBar`.
- Caching: `ContentStore` list-row cache for Home/Library summaries shipped; item-facts TTL and
  paginated grid cache still open ([01-foundation](docs/en/features/01-foundation-continuity.md)).
